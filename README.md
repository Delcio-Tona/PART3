The app allows users to add an unlimited number of recipes.

Users can enter additional details for each ingredient, including the number of calories and the food group it belongs to.

Users can delete all recipes at once

Users can view a list of all recipes and choose a recipe to view its details.

The app displays the total calories for each recipe. This time we use Piechart to display calories for better functional understanding.

Now the calculated total calories are displayed correctly.
